# SwiftUILists : Building a simple List based app using SwiftUI
---
Create a simple multiplatform practice app using SwiftUI for Mac, iOS and iPadOS.

## Overview
---
This is a demo app that showcases how easy it is to spin up a list based app in SwiftUI. There are 4 tab surfaces in this demo:
1. Posts
2. Photos
3. CoreData
4. Grid

It uses `async/ await` concurrency api's for network interaction, and uses the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` api's as network api source. 
This is a simple REST api, and can be used by developers free of cost for testing their demo apps.
